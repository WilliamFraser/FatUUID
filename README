About
-----
setfatuuid and getfatuuid are bash scripts that set and read the UUID of a fat
partition.  I wrote these to change the UUID of a SD card when I upgraded the
card in my phone to a higher capacity one, but needed to keep the UUID the same
to avoid confusing apps on my phone.

Be Aware
--------
Just to reiterate, this program is provided as is without any warranty.  I'm
not a profesional software developer.  I have tested it but not under every
possible circumstance, or in every possible situation, and there may well be
bugs that I've not spotted.  It changes data on your drives at a byte level.
There is no undo option.  As such there is no warranty, and you use it
entirely at your own risk, and by using this software, you agree to this.
I accept no liability whatsoever for any consequence of you using it.

That said, I do try and make it as reliable as possible, and if you spot any
problems, bugs, or flaws, please email me at william.fraser@virgin.net with
full details, and if possible I will try and fix them (depending on the
circumstances, and my decision is final).  Alternatively feel free to submit
bug corrections directly to the github site where this project is hosted.

I would encourage anyone to look through the scripts before using them (they
are not long, and are commented).

Instalation
-----------
The scripts can be run from any directory.  Everything it uses are installed by
default on most linux ditrobutions.

Running
-------
You run it from the command line.  If the file permissions are correct (if not
use "chmod 755 DirCmp.py" without quotes to make it executable) then simply
type in either the full path (i.e. "/home/william/getfatuuid /dev/sda" without
quotes), or if you are in the same directory, then "./getfatuuid /dev/sda"
again without quotes.

getfatuuid only needs one argument: the filename for the block device you are
interested in.

setfatuuid needs two arguments: the filename of the block device for the
partition you wich to change, and the UUID you wish to change it to.
